livedb-rethink
==============


RethinkDB database adapter for [livedb](https://github.com/share/livedb).
This driver can be used both as a snapshot store and oplog.

## Install

```sh
npm install --save livedb-rethink
```

## Schema

### Requirements

TODO

#### Snapshots Table

```javascript

{
	"data":  "Intersting text" ,
	"id":  "docName" ,
	"m": {
		"ctime": 1426789227620 ,
		"mtime": 1426790262477
	} ,
	"type": http://sharejs.org/types/textv1, Â»
	"v": 0
}

```

#### Operations Table

```javascript
{
	"id":  "docName v1" ,
	"m": {
		"ts": 1426789258264
	} ,
	"name":  "docName" ,
	"op": [
		15 ,
		"0" ,
		25 ,
		"Intersting text"
	] ,
	"preValidate": { } ,
	"seq": 2 ,
	"src":  "d73321d8db0fa4c51c28bdc57d22152f" ,
	"v": 1 ,
	"validate": { }
}
```

### Example

Here is an example statement that will work with sharejs and livedb-rethinkdb
note: you should already create a db called 'docShare' with two tables: 'users' and 'users_ops'
In the RethinkDD Data Explorer you should create a  compoundIndex like so
```javascript
r.db("docShare").table("users_ops").indexCreate("operations", [r.row("name"), r.row("v")])
```
now you can try

```javascript

var livedb = require('livedb');
var sharejs = require('share');

var dbConfig = {
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 28015,
  authKey: '',
  db: 'docShare',
};

var livedbrethink = require('livedb-rethink');
var db = require('livedb-rethink')(dbConfig);

var backend = livedb.client(db);
var share = sharejs.server.createClient({backend: backend});

```

## Usage

```javascript

TODO

```


## Testing

After creating database tables:

```sh
npm test
```
